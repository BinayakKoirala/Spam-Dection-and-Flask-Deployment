# Spam-Dection-and-Flask-Deployment

In this project, I have applied different ML algorithm inorder to predict whether the message is spam or not. And Among different algorithms applied, the best result is found using MultiNomial Naive Bayes Algorithm. So, I have created a model using MultiNomial Naive Bayes Algorithm. Then, I have deployed it using Flask. I hope you like it. And, if any error is found, please feel easy to email me at binayaktv@gmail.com .
